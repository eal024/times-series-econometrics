Collection of scrips and topics of time series econometrics.

## Simulation of time series data

## Visualize time series data


## AR and MA
- [AR]() Interpretation and visualization, [theoretical and empirical data, plotted the ACF](ar_graph_emprical_and_theory.R)
- [MA]() 

# Test of stationarity
- The `urca::ur.df()`function. Testing for stationarity (presence of a unit root). 
- [Example](https://github.com/eal024/times-series-econometrics/blob/main/2024-02-09%20stationarity_example.R) of non-stationary and stationary data. Using both `urca::ur.df()` and `tseries::adf.test()` to interpret the result. The example is based on this [blogpost:](https://rpubs.com/richkt/269797)
